        "acity": "Alien City is a combination Piecepack/Icehouse game about building a city on a newly colonized world. Four guilds compete for customers, and the player has to predict which bets are going to pay off. Each turn, the player places either a tower or dome and may optionally claim a tower they think is going to score big when the game ends. Play continues until no more construction is possible. Scores are based on the relative positions of buildings to claimed towers.",

The goal is to have the largest group of stones on the board when the board is full of stones, but as you get closer to winning, your opponent gets more powerful. Whereas most stone-placement games are about position, Catchup is about timing, position, and the interplay between them.",

        "chase": "Chase is a unique move and capture game played on a cylindrical hex board with dice. Pieces move the exact number of spaces showing on the die face (its \"speed\"). Landing on enemy pieces captures them; landing on friendly pieces bumps them, which can cause chain reactions. The chamber in the centre of the board is a way of gaining more pieces. You must maintain a total of 25 speed throughout the game. Once you are no longer able to do that, you lose.",

        "fabrik": "In Fabrik, players manipulate workers to determine where pieces can be placed. The goal is to get a certain number of your pieces in a row. In the default game, players can move either worker. The \"Arbeiter\" variant gives each player control over a specific worker.",

If one player is in a position where they no longer have such a ring anywhere on the board for any reason, they lose.",

The game ends when someone runs out of pieces, and the winner is the player who captured the most points.",

On your turn, you may either (1) place a piece of your colour and a neutral colour on an empty space, or (2) swap two neutral pieces to your colour and one of your piece to the neutral colour.",

In the placement phase, each player must place 1 to 3 ships until all ships are placed.\n* The \"Freeform\" variant allows you to place whatever ships you want (maximum of three at a time) until both players \"pass.\" This lets you create unbalanced or otherwise asymmetrical fleets.\n\nGames default to having one island in the centre of the field. Both a \"no islands\" and a \"two islands\" variant are available. You cannot move or fire through islands. To successfully hit a ship, at least one corner of your ship's triangle must have a clear view of at least one corner of the target ship.\n\nRemember that it is possible to get your ship in a position against an island or the edge of the board such that you can no longer move that ship! Be careful!",

Each player places a piece on their *opponent's* Order board and then makes a move on their *own* Order board; players thus act as both Order and Chaos at the same time. The player with the greatest score wins! Since both players had the exact same placement choices, this provides the cleanest measure of relative skill.",
