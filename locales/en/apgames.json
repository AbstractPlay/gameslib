Furthermore, cross lines don't get counted at all unless there are at least two cards in the line. So playing a new cross card (in our example, a 6) does not automatically score you a \"biscuit\" (playing a card on the main line that matches a cross line).\n\nMore information on the Decktet system can be found on the [official Decktet website](https://www.decktet.com).

It is possible to bonus grow onto a space that an edible bug is on.

Highest accumulated score wins.\n\nBasic scoring: For each orthogonally adjacent card, add the ranks together.\n* 2-9 w/ matching Ace: gain, otherwise lose\n* 10: no effect\n* 11: draw a card\n* 12-19: gain sum - 10\n* 20: draw a card\n\nPairs: For each orthogonally adjacent card that is the same rank, gain 5 points. (**Exception:** If that pair is also part of a set, it does *not* also score as a pair.)\n\nSets: If the placed card creates a line (including diagonal) of three *or more* cards of the same rank, gain 30 pts for each line.\n\nStraights: If the placed card creates or extends sequence of three or more cards in rank order along a line (including diagonal), gain 20 points for each line.\n\nPower play: If you played an Ace or Crown orthogonally adjacent to the matching Ace or Crown, score the number of points equal to the sum of the ranks of all the *other* cards in the tableau that share that suit.\n\nMore information on the Decktet system can be found on the [official Decktet website](https://www.decktet.com).
