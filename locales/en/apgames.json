        "unlur": "An asymmetric connection game where one player tries to form a Y and the other tries to connect opposite sides. Achieving the opponent's goal without achieving your own is a loss. The game starts with a contract phase where both players place the colour of the Y player until someone passes, and then the opponent becomes the Line player.",

        "volo": "Volo was inspired by the beauty of birds flying in flocks. Each player in turn places a piece or moves one or more pieces (here called 'birds') on the board and attempts to connect them all in one contiguous 'flock'.

        "armadas": "There are known issues with this game on iOS devices.\n\nThis game offers two scenarios:\n\n* The default is each player having two trios of pieces. In the placement phase, each player must place 1 to 3 ships until all ships are placed.\n* The \"Freeform\" variant allows you to place whatever ships you want (maximum of three at a time) until both players \"pass.\" This lets you create unbalanced or otherwise asymmetrical fleets.\n\nGames default to having one island in the centre of the field. Both a \"no islands\" and a \"two islands\" variant are available. You cannot move or fire through islands. To successfully hit a ship, at least one corner of your ship's triangle must have a clear view of at least one corner of the target ship.\n\nRemember that it is possible to get your ship in a position against an island or the edge of the board such that you can no longer move that ship! Be careful!",

Also, translations of the rules tend to omit certain nuances. This implementation conforms with the original French edition of the rules.",

The button is used when the komi value plus the number of intersections on the board is even, and any player may take a turn off and claim the button if it has yet to be claimed. The game ends when both players pass in succession, but claiming the button does not count toward this. Players cannot pass until the entire board is occupied or controlled.",
